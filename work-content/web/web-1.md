## Overview

Zendesk was launching an AI-led support service and wanted to show they understood that AI isn’t always helpful; you need to really understand it to use it well.

Building on that insight, I led the production of four animated characters, each one showing how AI can go wrong. They helped highlight Zendesk’s grasp of the AI landscape and positioned their product as a smarter, more thoughtful solution.

I worked closely with creatives, 3D designers, copywriters, and a sound studio to bring the campaign to life, managing budgets, timelines, and client relationships along the way. I kept both internal and external stakeholders updated throughout and refined the 3D animation process as we went to optimize both quality and speed.

The project was a huge success, earning millions of views and impressions worldwide and even picking up a Webby nomination.
